### Problem 2

Describe the raw data. Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore,
MD”) and then summarize within cities to obtain the total number of
homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the
disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

``` r
homicide_df <- 
  read_csv("homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
         resolution = case_when(
           disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
           disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
           disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
         )) %>% 
  relocate(uid, reported_date, city_state)
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (8): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_sex, city, stat...
    ## dbl (4): reported_date, victim_age, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
  homicide_df %>% 
    group_by(disposition,city) %>% 
  count()
```

    ## # A tibble: 145 × 3
    ## # Groups:   disposition, city [145]
    ##    disposition      city            n
    ##    <chr>            <chr>       <int>
    ##  1 Closed by arrest Albuquerque   232
    ##  2 Closed by arrest Atlanta       600
    ##  3 Closed by arrest Baltimore    1002
    ##  4 Closed by arrest Baton Rouge   228
    ##  5 Closed by arrest Birmingham    453
    ##  6 Closed by arrest Boston        304
    ##  7 Closed by arrest Buffalo       202
    ##  8 Closed by arrest Charlotte     481
    ##  9 Closed by arrest Chicago      1462
    ## 10 Closed by arrest Cincinnati    385
    ## # … with 135 more rows

The raw data set has 52,179 rows and 12 columns and include variables
such as uid, reported date, victim lastname, victim firstname, victim
race, victim age, victim sex, city and state.

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate
the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of
prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull
the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting
tidy dataframe.

Focus on Baltimore, MD.

``` r
baltimore_summary <- 
 homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"),
    n = n()
  )

baltimore_test <- 
  prop.test(
    x = baltimore_summary$unsolved,
    n = baltimore_summary$n) 
baltimore_test %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(estimate, starts_with("conf"))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1    0.646    0.628     0.663

Now run prop.test for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract
both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval
for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map,
purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy
dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city.

Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out
geom_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower
limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved
homicides.

Write a function.

``` r
prop_test_function <- 
  function(city_df) {
    city_summary <- 
      city_df %>% 
      summarize(
        unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"),
        n = n()
      )
    
    city_test <- 
      prop.test(
        x = city_summary$unsolved,
        n = city_summary$n)
    
    return(city_test)
  }

prop_test_function(homicide_df)
```

    ## 
    ##  1-sample proportions test with continuity correction
    ## 
    ## data:  city_summary$unsolved out of city_summary$n, null probability 0.5
    ## X-squared = 13.203, df = 1, p-value = 0.0002796
    ## alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.5036634 0.5122614
    ## sample estimates:
    ##        p 
    ## 0.507963

Iterate across all cities.

``` r
results_df <- 
  homicide_df %>% 
  nest(data = uid:resolution) %>% 
  mutate(
    test_results = map(data, prop_test_function),
    tidy_results = map(test_results, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select( tidy_results) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_results) #%>% 
  #select(city_state, estimate, starts_with("conf"))
```

Make a plot showing the estimates and confidence intervals.

``` r
#results_df %>% 
#  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
#  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
#  geom_point() +
#  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
#  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```
